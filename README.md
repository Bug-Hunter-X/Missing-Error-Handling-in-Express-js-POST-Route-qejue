# Missing Error Handling in Express.js POST Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling for request bodies in POST routes.

## Description

The `bug.js` file shows an Express.js route that creates a new user.  It fails to handle cases where the request body (`req.body`) is empty or invalid. This can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior, especially if database interactions are involved.

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the correct approach, including comprehensive error handling to prevent these issues.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory.
3. Run `node bug.js`.
4. Send a POST request to `/users` with an empty or malformed JSON body (or missing body). Observe the error response (or crash).
5. Run `node bugSolution.js`. Send the same request.  Observe the improved error handling.

## Solution

The solution involves adding robust checks to validate the request body before processing it.  Appropriate HTTP status codes should be used to communicate errors effectively to the client.
